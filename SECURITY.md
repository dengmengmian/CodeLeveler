# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Use GitHub's **Report a vulnerability** flow on the repository's Security tab
to send a private report. Include the affected version or commit, platform,
configuration, reproduction steps, impact, and any suggested mitigation.

If private vulnerability reporting is unavailable, contact a repository
maintainer privately through the contact information on their GitHub profile.
Do not include API keys, access tokens, private source code, or other secrets in
the initial report.

You should receive an acknowledgement within seven days. Timelines for a fix and
disclosure depend on severity, affected platforms, and whether downstream users
need time to update.

## Scope

Security-sensitive areas include:

- Workspace path and symbolic-link boundaries.
- Command permissions, sandbox capability reporting, and process-tree cleanup.
- Tool-call validation and approval handling.
- Credential redaction in logs, events, session storage, and artifacts.
- Provider and MCP transport authentication.
- Session isolation and local runtime transport.

Reports about a provider's service, an operating-system sandbox implementation,
or a third-party dependency may need to be coordinated with that upstream
project.

## Supported versions

Until CodeLeveler reaches 1.0, security fixes are applied to the latest release
and the default branch. Older pre-release versions may not receive backports.
